Students seeking additional help can browse the tutor marketplace, filtering by subject expertise, ratings, and pricing. After booking and paying for sessions, they join video calls with tutors for personalized instruction. The AI tutor provides 24/7 support for quick questions and practice exercises, adapting to each student's learning pace.
